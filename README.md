# Weather Forecast Web Application

## Project Description

This project involves creating an optimized cities table and a weather forecast web application using React. TypeScript is optional but recommended for type safety. The application includes functionalities for displaying cities, viewing detailed weather forecasts, and managing user interactions effectively.

## Core Requirements

### Cities Table

- **Data Source**: Use the [Geonames API](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/api/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name) to fetch city data.
- **Display**: Show city information in a table format, including columns for city name, country, timezone, etc.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implement infinite scroll to load more cities as the user scrolls down.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search-as-you-type feature with autocomplete to suggest locations.
- **Filter and Sort**: Allow users to filter and sort the table columns.
- **Navigation**: Clicking on a city name should navigate to a weather page for that city. Right-clicking and opening in a new tab should also navigate to the weather page.

### Weather Page

- **Data Source**: Use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org) to fetch weather data.
- **Display Information**: Show current weather details, including temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Display forecasts with temperature highs and lows, descriptions, and precipitation chances.
- **Optional Features**: Display the location on a map, provide options for changing units, etc.
- **Sync with Cities Table**: Show basic weather information like day high/low on the cities table page once the weather data is loaded.

## Additional Requirements

### Styling

- **Design**: Use an appropriate color palette and style components to design the layouts and pages.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Implement dynamic backgrounds based on current weather conditions.
- **Weather Representations**: Use images or animations to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

### Responsive Design

- **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Implement media queries or responsive design techniques as needed.

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Handling**: Handle errors gracefully in case of failed API requests or invalid search queries.
- **Error Messages**: Display error messages to users when necessary.

### State Management

- **State Management**: Utilize React state management to display data and avoid re-fetching. Manage weather data state centrally and pass down necessary data as props.

### Type Safety

- **TypeScript**: Utilize TypeScript for type safety throughout the application.
- **Interfaces/Types**: Define interfaces or types for weather objects and API responses.

## Optional Features

- **Stack Preferences**: Use preferred stack elements such as Next.js for the frontend framework, MST (MobX State Tree) for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Geolocation**: Implement geolocation to detect and display the weather for the user's current location automatically.
- **History**: Maintain a history of viewed locations' weather.
- **Favorites**: Add a feature to save favorite locations for quick access.
- **Unit Switching**: Provide options to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit, metric/imperial).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
